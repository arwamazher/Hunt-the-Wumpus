# Hunt-the-Wumpus
This program prompts the user to navigate through a cave with obstacles in order to guess where the Wumpus monster is.
The Wumpus lives in a dark cave consisting of 20 rooms. Each room has 3 tunnels that lead to other rooms.

HAZARDS:
1. Two rooms have bottomless pits in them. If you enter a room with a pit, you will fall and die. 

2. Two other rooms have super-bats that grab you and fly you to some other random room, which could be troublesome.

3. The Wumpus is immune to the pits and super-bats because he has sucker feet and is too heavy for the bats to lift.
   Usually he is sleeping, but two things wake him up: anytime you shoot an arrow or enter his room. Be careful of 
   the Wumpus! If you enter his room and it is even-numbered, he will snap your neck and you die. Otherwise, he moves
   to another room.
